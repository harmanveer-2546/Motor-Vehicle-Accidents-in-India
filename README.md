# Motor Vehicle Accidents in India

Road accidents notoriously have been accounting for the maximum share of accidents that happen using any mode of transportation. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control (USA), transportation accidents accounted for 31.9 percent of accidental deaths reported in 2010.

Road accidents are not just traumatic experiences for the driver, passenger, or third parties involved, it's also traumatic events for the near and
dear ones of those who are directly impacted by the outcome of the accident. Having experienced one road accident myself, I have always thought about 
what various reasons could lead to roads becoming more unsafe each day.

###  Questions :

Q1: Which mode of transport has resulted in the maximum loss of lives?

Q2: Which mode of transport has maximum increased deaths year over year?

Q3: Which mode of transport has decreased the maximum year over year ?

Q4: Which mode of travel has the maximum driver deaths ?

Q5: Which mode of travel results in the maximum loss of lives for victims?

### Conclusion

It's great to see the number of fatal accidents has been steadily decreasing, but it's also alarming to see the rate at which the number of deaths 
involving two-wheelers has increased. It might be because of the fewer safety features available to the two-wheelers that lead to more fatal accidents
as compared to any other mode of transport.
